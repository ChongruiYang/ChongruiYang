- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChongruiYang, a dog who dig data source, try to pursue a econ PHD position in the future
- 👀 I’m interested in anything about econ research, now I am focusing on the urban economics, spatial economics, and industrial structure changes. I hope to use structural methods to meticulously quantify the effect of Entry of industries and amenity, and I hope to work on Agglomeration Economics in the future, and perhaps this will also intersect with Spatial Economics or Economic History.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning and NLP for text analysis in research projects, now I am good at data cleaning using stata and sql, python and matlab are also ok
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Econ RA for several research groups including public finance, real estate and urban econ. I'm dealing with several kinds of urban data like remote-sensing data(Landsat series about pollution:PM2.5, NO2, etc.), Nightlight Data(NPP-VIIRS Data), User Online Comment in Restaurants(from Crawler of Openrice, Yelp, etc.), News Extraction from Main Media Post(from Crawler of Google Search, Factiva). I've also previously processed a billion levels of cell phone signal data in U.S.(from Veraset) to help carve out residents' consumption habits; and million levels of Chinese Business Registration Dataset to run large-scale business scope clustering.
