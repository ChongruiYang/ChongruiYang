- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChongruiYang, a PHD student of Economic Department of CUHK who dig data source, try to pursue a working position in the future
- 👀 I’m interested in anything about econ research, now I am focusing on the urban economics, spatial economics, and industrial structure changes. I hope to use structural methods to meticulously quantify the effect of Entry of industries and amenity, and I hope to work on Agglomeration Economics in the future, and perhaps this will also intersect with Spatial Economics or Economic History.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning and NLP for text analysis in research projects, now I am good at data cleaning using stata and sql, python, matlab and Linux are also ok. ArcGIS Pro(Arcpy) is the most suitable tool for me in dealing with works on urban part.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Econ RA for several research groups including public finance, real estate and urban econ. I'm dealing with several kinds of urban data like remote-sensing data(Landsat series about pollution:PM2.5, NO2, etc.), Nightlight Data(NPP-VIIRS Data), User Online Comment in Restaurants(from Crawler of Openrice, Yelp, etc.), News Extraction from Main Media Post(from Crawler of Google Search, Factiva). I've also previously processed a billion levels of cell phone signal data in U.S.(from Veraset) to help identify residents' consumption habits; and million levels of Chinese Business Registration Dataset to run large-scale business scope clustering.
